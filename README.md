# Host footprint project

This is a learning project created to help me on my python learning journey, mixing security and python programming. The intention of this tool, when finished is to provide a complete footprint of a given domain or IP that contains:
* Dns records
* Dns Subdomains
* Whois information 
* Open network ports and service banners
* Shodan banners
* Web Frameworks fingerprint if a web app
* SSL certificates dump and pasrsing
* Known vulnerabilities related to everything found in the list above

## Future features:
* Generate PDF and xls reports with the findings
* Store all this in a database
* Allow a db search form a minimalist web UI
